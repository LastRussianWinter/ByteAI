# How to Use ByteAI

After execution, the AI should run automatically if its in a game that it works in, if it isnt or their is an error (Maybe due by a Game Update or the game has already been tampered with) the bot will not run automatically, however it will give you a warning message, and what thing is making it not work (PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT SOME GAMES MAY COME OFF THE SUPPORTED LIST AND BACK ON)
